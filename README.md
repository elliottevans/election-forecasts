# Election Forecasts 2016

This is the hub for my 2016 election forecasts, along with relevant visualizations and post-mortem. The R script that handles the bulk of the data munging and forecasting is [main.R](main.R). This script uses a nearest neighbor algorithm on information like historical polling and days till the election to generate simulations of the electoral map.

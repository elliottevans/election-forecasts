# Election Forecasts 2016

This is the hub for my 2016 election forecasts, along with relevant visualizations and post-mortem. The R script that handles the bulk of the data munging and forecasting is [main.R](main.R). This script uses a nearest neighbor algorithm on information like historical polling and days till the election to generate simulations of the electoral map.

## Project Page

The project page for these forecasts is hosted [here](https://elliottevans.github.io/election_forecasts).

## Post-mortem

The project post-mortem can be found [here](https://medium.com/@elliott.evans/were-forecasters-wrong-about-donald-trump-ae36e26a0c6a).
